# Versions

Major version 1 of this crate uses [gsasl-sys](https://crates.io/crates/gsasl-sys) which are binding
to [GNU gsasl](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsasl). This makes the use of `unsafe` code and FFI necessary.
You can find the latest 1.X.Y version in the [branch `1.X.X`](https://github.com/dequbed/rsasl/tree/1.X.X)

Version `2.0.0-preview` is a pure-Rust rewrite using sources transpiled using [c2rust](https://github.com/immunant/c2rust).
Keep in mind that despite being Rust this code is as least as unsafe as the original C code. Most of this unsafe 
code will be removed before the first non-preview `2.0.0` release.
