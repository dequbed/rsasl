rsasl is an framework for [RFC 4422](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4422); the Simple Authentication and Security
Layer - aka SASL.

It is designed to enable implementing SASL support in protocol handling crates while abstracting away the details,
allowing downstream users to select available mechanisms and add support for additional mechanisms without any
changes required in the protocol handling crate.

rsasl provide a number of mechanisms by itself:

- ANONYMOUS
- EXTERNAL
- GSSAPI
- LOGIN
- OAUTHBEARER
- PLAIN
- SCRAM-SHA-1 and SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS
- SCRAM-SHA-256 and SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS
- SCRAM-SHA-512 and SCRAM-SHA-512-PLUS
- XOAUTH2

Support for the following mechanisms was available in rsasl 1 but is not yet implemented in rsasl 2:

- OPENID20
- SAML20
- GS2-KRB5
- KERBEROS_V5
- NTLM
- SECURID
- CRAM-MD5
- DIGEST-MD5

Additional mechanisms can be implemented by other crates. (**NOTE: In the current `v2.0.0` this feature is unstable**)

## Conditional compilation of mechanism

rsasl allows users to select the available mechanisms at compile time using cargo features.
For an overview refer to the module documentation of `rsasl::mechanisms`.

## MSRV - Minimum Supported Rust Version

The current msrv rsasl is Rust `0`, however do note that certain features (e.g. `registry_static`) have
dependencies with much more recent msrv.

## Versions

The [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) contains a detailed release history, including added features and fixed bugs.

Major version 1 of this crate uses [gsasl-sys](https://crates.io/crates/gsasl-sys) which are binding
to [GNU gsasl](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsasl). This makes the use of `unsafe` code and FFI necessary.
You can find the latest 1.X.Y version in the [branch `1.X.X`](https://github.com/dequbed/rsasl/tree/1.X.X)

Version `2.0.0` is a pure-Rust rewrite of this crate that is able to drop almost all `unsafe` code from the crate.
The `main` branch contains the tagged stable releases, the current state of development can be found in the `development` state.

## License

Version 2 and later of this library are dual licensed under both [Apache-2.0](LICENSE.APACHE-2.0) and
[MIT](LICENSE.MIT), at your option.
