/// Trait implemented to be one party in an authentication exchange
///
/// This trait is used irrespectively of the side of the authentication exchange, i.e. it gets
/// used both on the client side and on the server side. If the Mechanism being implemented is not
/// symmetric but has different behaviour depending on the side an Implementation should define two
/// distinct types representing the client and server side:
///
/// and register the two types separately
pub trait Authentication: Send + Sync {
    /// Do a single step of authentication with the other party
    ///
    /// rsasl has a few assumptions about the behaviour of any implementor of this trait:
    ///
    /// - [`State::Finished`] must only be returned if no further calls to `step` are expected in
    ///   **any case**. If another `step` may occur on e.g. an error [`State::Running`] **MUST**
    ///   be returned.
    /// - Calling `step` after the last call returned `State::Finished` is undefined behaviour.
    ///   An implementation is free to write garbage data into the writer, return an error or panic.
    ///
    /// - If the current/local side of the authentication is going **first** a call to `step` with
    ///   an input of `None` will generate the first batch of data.
    /// - When a mechanism is called with no input or an empty input when this was not expected, a
    ///   mechanism **MUST** return an Error. [`SessionError::InputDataRequired`] is a safe
    ///   default here, but if this behaviour results in e.g. the server not being
    ///   mutually authenticated other [`SessionError`]s or [`MechanismError`]s can be appropriate.
    ///
    ///   Most importantly, a mechanisms **MUST NOT** return `Ok(State::Running)` as this
    ///   can result in an infinite loop if both sides of the authentication think the other
    ///   should go first.
    /// - In case an `Err(InputDataRequired)` is returned a second call to step *with* data
    ///   **SHOULD** continue the authentication exchange as if the invalid call never happened.
    ///   This means if input data is required but was not provided the internal state **SHOULD**
    ///   remain the same and not become invalid.
    ///
    /// - The server side implemented of a mechanism **MUST** call [`MechanismData::validate`]
    ///   *exactly once* in an authentication exchange, unless a protocol error is encountered.
    ///   (i.e. the call has to have happened before `Ok(State::Finished(_))` is returned)
    ///
    ///   `validate` is passed a `Provider` giving user callbacks access to property values from
    ///   this exchange to base authentication decisions on. This Provider **MUST** always
    ///   provide the same set of properties; if a property may be absent in some circumstances it
    ///   **MUST** specify and return a special 'absent' value in those cases.
