 * @short_description: register new application-defined mechanism
 *
 * The builtin mechanisms should suffice for most applications.
 * Applications can register a new mechanism in the library using
 * application-supplied functions.  The mechanism will operate as the
 * builtin mechanisms, and the supplied functions will be invoked when
 * necessary.  The application uses the normal logic, e.g., calls
 * gsasl_client_start() followed by a sequence of calls to
 * gsasl_step() and finally gsasl_finish().
